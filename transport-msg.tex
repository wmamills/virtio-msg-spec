\section{Virtio Over Messages}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages}

The goal of the messages transport is to have commands communicated between the
frontend (driver) and backend (device) sides over a message based conduit
allowing to reach destination endpoints such as another VM, a TEE or a remote
compute engine using different communication channels.

The messages transport is designed to work efficiently between VMs on an hypervisor
based configuration or between heterogeneous systems by using messages to
reduce the number of context switches between the device and the driver sides
when each of them is in a different VM. In the same way, this is also reducing
cross system communications required in an heterogeneous system configuration.

\subsection{Messages Format}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Messages Format}

The messages have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item A message size is 40 bytes.
\item Most messages are driver/device initialisation messages.
\item Messages are expected to be sent at low frequencies and quick roundtrip is
  not necessary and should not impact global performances (as communication
  requiring performance should use virtqueues).
\end{itemize}

The virtio-MSG messages are encoded as following:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|l|X|}
\hline
Name & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE & 0 & 1 & Bit[0]: 0=Request, 1=Answer \newline Bit[1]: 0=virtio-msg, 1=bus-msg \newline Bit[2-7]: Reserved \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_ID & 1 & 1 & Message ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_DEV_ID & 2 & 2 & Device ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_PAYLOAD & 4 & 36 & Payload \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\newcommand{\msgdef}[1]{\subsubsection{VIRTIO_MSG_#1}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Messages Definition / VIRTIO_MSG_#1}}

\msgdef{ERROR}

The Error message is used to signal to the driver or the device that a message
it wanted to send could not be sent.

The message contain an error code defined using the Standard Posix Error Codes
(TODO: add a reference) and the Message ID of the request that triggered the
error (or 0 if the error was not in answer to a specific request).

The message also contains a Data Type that can be set to STRING to use the
rest of the payload to give a NULL terminating string that can be used to carry
extra printable information.

This message can be received by the driver or the device and can be sent as an
answer to an other message by the driver or the device or any element between
them involved in the communication.

configuration value at the offset after the modification to give a chance to the
driver to detect changes that have not been accepted by the device.

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\

The Event config message is sent by the device to signal to the driver that one
or several values in the device configuration have changed. The message
contains the current device status (as encoded in the GET\_DEVICE\_STATUS
answer) and optionally the part of the configuration that has been modified. If
this is not provided, the driver will have to use the GET\_CONFIG to retrieve
the configuration and discover what has changed.

This message is sent by the device to the driver and does not expect any
answer.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}

\subsection{Message Bus}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus}

The Message Bus acts as a communication channel between two endpoints,
providing a standardised abstraction to exchange messages.

The Message Bus transmits the messages between the frontend and the backend in
both directions.

A system can have several Message Busses and it shall respect the following
principles:

\begin{itemize}
\item One Message Bus has a backend and a frontend side located in 2 different
      endpoints (an endpoint can be a VM, a secure Partition or a remote OS).
\item One Message Bus has one or more devices on the backend side handled by
      drivers on the frontend side.
\item An endpoint can be connected to several Message Busses.
\end{itemize}

A Message Bus implementation must provide interfaces to transmit and receive
messages with the other side.

While the Bus implementation and how communication of the messages is done
between the devices and the drivers is completely out of the scope of the
specification, this chapter provides a set of standard Bus messages to help
standardizing as much as possible a part of the bus implementation.

\subsubsection{Discovery}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Discovery}

The Message Bus is responsible of listing the available busses and to enumerate
all devices available on each bus.

This can be done in a static way, using a device tree for example, or in a way
using messages to discover from the frontend side which device IDs are
available on the backend side (using the BUS_MSG_GET_DEVICES bus message).

\subsubsection{Message Format}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Message Format}

The Bus messages are transfered using the \emph{bus-msg} type in
VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE and have the following format:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|l|X|}
\hline
Name & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE & 0 & 1 & Bit[0]: 0=Request, 1=Answer \newline Bit[1]: 1=bus-msg \newline Bit[2-7]: Reserved \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_ID & 1 & 1 & Message ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_PAYLOAD & 2 & 38 & Payload \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{Message Definition}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Message Definition}

The following table is listing the different Virtio-MSG Bus messages and the
sender for each of them.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Name & ID & Sender \\
\hline
\hline
Reserved                    & 0x0  &        \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_ERROR               & 0x1  & Any    \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_GET_DEVICES         & 0x2  & Driver \\

BUS_MSG_DEVICE_ADDED        & 0x3  & Device \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_DEVICE_REMOVED      & 0x4  & Device \\

\hline
BUS_MSG_RESET               & 0x6  & Driver  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Bus message ID 6-127 are reserved for future use in the specification and
message ID 128-255 can be used for implementation specific needs.

The following sections are giving more details of the usage of each message
and the encoding of the payload for the request and answer (when applicable).

\newcommand{\busdef}[1]{\paragraph{BUS_MSG_#1}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Message Definition / BUS_MSG_#1}}

\busdef{ERROR}

The Error message is used by one side of the bus to inform the other side that
one message could not be processed correctly. The message contains an error
code defined using the Standard Posix Error Codes (TODO: add a reference).

This message shall be used for Bus errors not specific to a particular device.
In case of a device specific error not impacting the complete bus, the
VIRTIO_MSG_ERROR shall be used.

As for the VIRTIO_MSG_ERROR, this message supports to have a NULL terminating
String that can be used to give more information printable to the user.

This message can be received by the frontend or the backend side and can be
send as answer to an other message or directly to signal an error.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Any     & 0 & 4 & Posix Error Code \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{GET_DEVICES}

The Get Devices message is used by the frontend to retrieve the ID of the
devices available on the backend of the bus.

The frontend requests the availibility at an offset and the backend returns a
bitmap in which each bit indicates if a device is available or not for this ID.

A request at offset X give the availability of devices X*32 to X*32 + 31.

The backend also return a next offset that indicates to the frontend what
offset to request next. This is to optimize the number of messages required in
a case where the device IDs have numbers far from each other.

This message shall be used in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item frontend request devices at offset 0.
\item backend answers with the availibility of devices 0 to 31 and indicates to
  the frontend what offset to request next.
\item frontend request devices at the offset mentioned by the device side.
\end{itemize}
This repeats until the backend gives a next offset of 0 meaning that no
more devices are available after the currently requested offset.

This message is sent by the frontend side of the bus to the backend side and
expects an answer from the backend side.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Request & 0 & 2 & Offset \\
        & 2 & 34 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
Answer & 0 & 2 & Offset \\
       & 2 & 2 & Next offset or 0 if no devices after Offset \\
       & 4 & 2 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
       & 6 & 32 & Bit[n]: Device[offset*32 + n] not availble(0)/available(1) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{DEVICE_ADDED}

This message is sent by the backend of the bus to signal to the frontend that
a new device appeared on the bus.

This message is sent by the backend of the bus and does not expect any answer.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\

Request & 0 & 2 & Device ID \\
        & 2 & 34 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{DEVICE_REMOVED}

This message is sent by the backend of the bus to signal to the frontend that
a device was removed from the bus.

This message is sent by the backend of the bus and does not expect any answer.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Request & 0 & 2 & Device ID \\
        & 2 & 34 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{PING}

The ping message can be sent by the backend or the frontend side of the bus
to check that the other side is responding properly.

This message can be used by either side to monitor that the other side of the
bus is available and functional.

The message contains a 32bit data field with a custom value that must be copied
back by the receiver in its answer.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Request & 0 & 4 & Data \\
        & 4 & 32 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
Answer & 0 & 4 & Request Data \\
       & 4 & 32 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{RESET}

This message is sent by the driver side of the bus to request the device side
to reset the bus and all devices on it.
This message shall be sent as first message by a Bus implementation to make
sure that no device is in an unknown state from a possible previous usage of
it by a driver.

TODO: shall this message be used for added/removed notif ?
