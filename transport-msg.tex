\section{Virtio Over Messages}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages}

The goal of the messages transport is to have commands communicated between the
frontend (driver) and backend (device) sides over a message based conduit
allowing to reach destination endpoints such as another VM, a TEE or a remote
compute engine using different communication channels.

The messages transport is designed to work efficiently between VMs on an hypervisor
based configuration or between heterogeneous systems by using messages to
reduce the number of context switches between the device and the driver sides
when each of them is in a different VM. In the same way, this is also reducing
cross system communications required in an heterogeneous system configuration.

\subsection{Messages Format}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Messages Format}

The messages have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item A message size is 40 bytes.
\item Most messages are driver/device initialisation messages.
\item Messages are expected to be sent at low frequencies and quick roundtrip is
  not necessary and should not impact global performances (as communication
  requiring performance should use virtqueues).
\end{itemize}

The virtio-MSG messages are encoded as following:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|l|X|}
\hline
Name & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE & 0 & 1 & Bit[0]: 0=Request, 1=Answer \newline Bit[1]: 0=virtio-msg, 1=bus-msg \newline Bit[2-7]: Reserved \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_ID & 1 & 1 & Message ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_DEV_ID & 2 & 2 & Device ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_PAYLOAD & 4 & 36 & Payload \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

and the encoding of the payload for the request and answer (when applicable).

\newcommand{\msgdef}[1]{\subsubsection{VIRTIO_MSG_#1}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Messages Definition / VIRTIO_MSG_#1}}

\msgdef{ERROR}

The Error message is used to signal to the driver or the device that a message
it wanted to send could not be sent.

The message contain an error code defined using the Standard Posix Error Codes
(TODO: add a reference) and the Message ID of the request that triggered the
error (or 0 if the error was not in answer to a specific request).

The message also contains a Data Type that can be set to STRING to use the
rest of the payload to give a NULL terminating string that can be used to carry
extra printable information.

This message can be received by the driver or the device and can be sent as an
answer to an other message by the driver or the device or any element between
them involved in the communication.

The Get features message is used to retrieve 256 bits of feature information
from the device. The driver request features at an index and the device answers
with the features bits at 256*index.

If there are no features available at and after the requested index, the
ERROR message can be used by the device to signal to the driver that there is
no need to scan for features at and after the requested index.

\end{tabular}

\msgdef{SET_FEATURES}

The Set features message is used by the driver to configure the features of a
device. The driver configures 256 bits a time a given index. The device
provides in the answer the actual features value at the index after having
configured the bit requested giving an opportunity for the driver to detect if
some of the bits it tried to set were not accepted.

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

configuration values of the device. The driver can modify up to 256 bits at a
given offset in the device configuration. The device answers with the actual
configuration value at the offset after the modification to give a chance to the
driver to detect changes that have not been accepted by the device.

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\

\end{tabular}

\msgdef{EVENT_CONFIG}

The Event config message is sent by the device to signal to the driver that one
or several values in the device configuration have changed. The message
contains the current device status (as encoded in the GET\_DEVICE\_STATUS
answer) and optionally the part of the configuration that has been modified. If
this is not provided, the driver will have to use the GET\_CONFIG to retrieve
the configuration and discover what has changed.

This message is sent by the device to the driver and does not expect any
answer.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\

\subsection{Message Bus}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus}

The Message Bus acts as a communication channel between two endpoints,
providing a standardised abstraction to exchange messages.

The Message Bus transmits the messages between the frontend and the backend in
both directions.
A system can have several Message Busses and it shall respect the following
principles:

\begin{itemize}
\item One Message Bus has a backend and a frontend side located in 2 different
      endpoints (an endpoint can be a VM, a secure Partition or a remote OS).
\item One Message Bus has one or more devices on the backend side handled by
      drivers on the frontend side.
\item An endpoint can be connected to several Message Busses.
\end{itemize}

A Message Bus implementation must provide interfaces to transmit and receive
messages from the other side.

\subsubsection{Discovery}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Discovery}

The Message Bus is responsible of listing the available busses and to enumerate
all devices available on each bus.

This can done in a static way using a device tree or in a more dynamic way using
messages to communicate with the other side of the bus to discover available
devices.

\subsubsection{Messages}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Messages}

While the Bus implementation and how communication of the messages is done
between the devices and the drivers is completely out of the scope of the
specification, this chapter provides a set of standard Bus messages to help
reusing as much as possible a part of the bus implementation.

The Bus messages are transfered using the *bus-msg* type in VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE and
have the following format:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|l|X|}
\hline
Name & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE & 0 & 1 & Bit[0]: 0=Request, 1=Answer \newline Bit[1]: 1=bus-msg \newline Bit[2-7]: Reserved \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_ID & 1 & 1 & Message ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_PAYLOAD & 2 & 38 & Payload \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

The following table is listing the different Bus messages and the sender for
each for them.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Name & ID & Sender \\
\hline
\hline
BUS_MSG_ERROR               & 0x0  & Any    \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_GET_DEVICES         & 0x1  & Driver \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_DEVICE_ADDED        & 0x2  & Device \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_DEVICE_REMOVED      & 0x3  & Device \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_PING                & 0x4  & Any    \\
\hline
BUS_MSG_RESET               & 0x5  & Driver  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Bus message ID 6-127 are reserved for future use in the specification and
message ID 128-255 can be used for implementation specific needs.

The following sections are giving more details of the usage of each message
and the encoding of the payload for the request and answer (when applicable).

\newcommand{\busdef}[1]{\paragraph{BUS_MSG_#1}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus / Messages / BUS_MSG_#1}}

\busdef{ERROR}

The Error message is used by one side of the bus to inform the other side that
one message could not be processed correctly. The message contains an error
code defined using the Standard Posix Error Codes (TODO: add a reference).

TODO: what cases, what content ?

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Any     & 0 & 4 & Posix Error Code \\
        & 4 & 34 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{GET_DEVICES}

The Get Devices message is used by the driver side to retrieve the ID of the
devices available on the device side of the bus.
The driver side requests the availibility at an offset and the device side of
the bus returns a bitmap in which each bit indicates if a device is available
or not for this ID. The device side also return a next offset that indicates
to the driver side what offset to request next.

This message shall be used in the following way:
- driver side request devices at offset 0.
- device side answers with the availibility of devices 0 to 31 and indicates to
  the driver what offset to request next.
- driver side request devices at the offset mentioned by the device side.
This repeats until the device side gives a next offset of 0 meaning that no
more devices are available after the currently requested offset.

This message is sent by the driver side of the bus to the device side and
expects an answer from the device side.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Request & 0 & 2 & Offset \\
        & 2 & 34 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
\hline
Answer & 0 & 2 & Offset \\
       & 2 & 2 & Next offset or 0 if no devices after Offset \\
       & 4 & 2 & Reserved (MBZ) \\
       & 6 & 32 & Bit[n]: Device[offset + n] not availble(0)/available(1) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\busdef{DEVICE_ADDED}

This message is sent by the device side of the bus to signal to the driver side
that a new device appeared on the bus.

TODO: when should the device side start sending those messages? how to detect
that the driver side did scan the bus and a new device appeared since ?
TODO: do we need a kind of init message to solve that ?

\busdef{DEVICE_REMOVED}

This message is sent by the device side of the bus to signal to the driver side
that a device was removed from the bus.

\busdef{PING}

TODO: confirm how keep alive should work and be configured.

\busdef{RESET}

This message is sent by the driver side of the bus to request the device side
to reset the bus and all devices on it.
This message shall be sent as first message by a Bus implementation to make
sure that no device is in an unknown state from a possible previous usage of
it by a driver.

TODO: shall this message be used for added/removed notif ?
